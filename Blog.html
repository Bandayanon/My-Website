            <h2>Gamekeeper</h2>
            <p>Gamekeeper is a hunter who excel in Chase and Chair Guarding with a series of traps and a hook in his arsenal
            When playing Gamekeeper it's to be sure that using his utility right is the key to winning the game, as a all or nothing
            hunter. Proper hook hits, target judgement, timing, hook travesing and trap placement is the difference between
            a decent Gamekeeper to a great Gamekeeper, in addition to the versatility he is equipped with, he is also a endgame
            hunter if played right as traps can hinder survivors from decoding exit gates or going through dungeons.</p>

                <h2>Mad Eyes</h2>
                <p>Mad Eyes is a hunter who excels in Map Control and Pressure, with access to Controllers, he becomes nigh-omnipresent
                everywhere in the map. With the ability to summon Fences around the map that lasts for a long time, he is an exceptional hunter
                Although powerful, he is one of, if not the hardest hunter to learn and use, so the difference between players playing him is high.
                If he is used and played well, he can keep survivors in his walls and render them trapped, even to the point where late game is useless
                against him.</p>
